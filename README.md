Codeforces User Problem Solving Statistics
The main objective of this project is to,gives an analysis of a compeitative programmer who has been practising in codeforces.
It will show the user,the statistics of the entered codeforces handle,in the form of a pie chart,consisting of the number of 
different genre of problems like implementations,DP,greedy choice,graph theory,math,etc solved by the user. This inturn will not
only help the user to analyse their skill and potential but also can help icpc-team coaches of a university or college in team formation.
i have made use of the Codeforces API,to get me the data that i need to generate the piechart. Codeforces API uses of JSON 
or Java Script Object Notation, where when an http request is send to the Codeforces server,a JSON object of the requested information is returned.
